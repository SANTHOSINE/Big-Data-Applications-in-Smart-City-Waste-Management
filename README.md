# Big-Data-Applications-in-Smart-City-Waste-Management
Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Big Data Analytics can help manage waste in smart cities efficiently. IoT-enabled dustbins collect data like waste level, type, and location. Using Python and Pandas, we analyze the data to:

Identify overflowing bins (>80%)

Determine average waste levels per location

Understand waste type distribution

Provide insights for optimal garbage collection

SDG Goal

SDG 11 â€“ Sustainable Cities & Communities
Goal: Make cities clean, safe, and sustainable by improving waste management.

Dataset

Simulated dataset waste_data.csv with 15 rows

Columns: Bin_ID | Location | Waste_Level | Waste_Type | Timestamp

Represents IoT sensor data from city dustbins

Features

Average waste level per location

Waste type distribution (Plastic, Organic, Paper, Metal)

Overflowing bin detection (>80% full)

Data visualization (Bar chart & Pie chart)

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

How to Run

Clone the repository

Ensure Python and Pandas are installed

Run waste_data.csv generation script (if dataset not present)

Run analysis.py to get outputs and charts

Outcome

Clear identification of high-waste areas

Visual insights for city authorities

Helps optimize garbage collection schedules
